Description: solr module for PHP 5
 The Apache Solr PHP extension is an extremely fast, light-weight, feature-rich library that allows PHP applications to communicate easily and efficiently with Apache Solr server instances using an object-oriented API.
 .
 It effectively simplifies the process of interacting with Apache
 Solr using PHP5 and it already comes with built-in readiness for
 the latest features.
 .
 The extension has features such as built-in, serializable query
 string builder objects which effectively simplifies the manipulation
 of name-value pair request parameters across repeated requests.
 The response from the Solr server is also automatically parsed
 into native php objects whose properties can be accessed as array
 keys or object properties without any additional configuration on
 the client-side.
 .
 Its advanced HTTP client reuses the same connection across multiple
 requests and provides built-in support for connecting to Solr servers
 secured behind HTTP Authentication or HTTP proxy servers. It is
 also able to connect to SSL-enabled containers.
 .
 Please consult the documentation for more details on
 features. Included in the source code are phpdoc stubs that enable
 autocomplete of Solr classes and methods in IDE during development
 in userland.
 .
 PECL Solr 2+ is only compatible with Apache Solr Server 4.0+
